Movie Recommendation System
This project is a Python-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on user ratings. By analyzing user preferences and similarities, the system provides tailored recommendations using data processing and graph-based relationships.

Features
User-Centric Recommendations: Generate personalized movie suggestions based on individual preferences.
Data-Driven Insights: Utilizes user-movie ratings data for similarity detection.
Graph Algorithms: Uses network analysis to uncover relationships between users and movies.
Code Overview
Files and Their Functions
recommend.py
This is the main script that executes the recommendation logic. It includes:

Importing and processing user-movie rating data.
Calculating user similarity based on ratings.
Generating movie recommendations.
Dependencies
The project uses the following Python libraries:

networkx: For graph-based similarity analysis.
collections: For efficient data handling.
Example Dataset
The script uses a dictionary structure to store user ratings, such as:

python
Copy code
user_ratings = {
    "User1": {"Inception": 5, "The Matrix": 4, "Interstellar": 5},
    "User2": {"Inception": 4, "The Prestige": 4, "The Dark Knight": 5},

}
How to Run the Code
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or later
Required libraries (install via requirements.txt if included, or install manually):
bash
Copy code
pip install networkx
Steps to Run
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
Prepare the Dataset:
The dataset is pre-defined in the script (user_ratings). If you want to use your own dataset, modify the user_ratings dictionary in recommend.py.

Run the Script:
Execute the script in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
python recommend.py
View Recommendations:
The script will output personalized movie recommendations for each user.

Example Output
Given the sample ratings:

python
Copy code
user_ratings = {
    "User1": {"Inception": 5, "The Matrix": 4},
    "User2": {"The Prestige": 5, "Inception": 3},
}
The system generates output like:

less
Copy code
Recommendations for User1: ['The Prestige']
Recommendations for User2: ['The Matrix']
